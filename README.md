# OPENGL_101
Setup Procedure:
Step 1) Clone the repositor
Step 2) Change build configuration to x86 (since the glut and glew libraries I am using are for x86)
Step 3) Copy freeglut.dll and glew32.dll from Dependencies folder to Debug folder. (Debug folder will be created once you run the app and it throws error for the first time)
